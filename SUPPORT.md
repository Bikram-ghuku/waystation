# Support

You are welcome to join our community for help and support. Before posting a question on Slack, please follow these guidelines to make your request clear and effective:

### Before Asking

* Review the project documentation.
* Check whether your issue is already covered in an open pull request or issue.
* Search existing discussions (Slack, GitHub issues, etc.).
* Do a quick review of the relevant codebase (e.g., using “Find in Files”).

### When Asking

* Clearly describe the problem.
* Explain the steps you have already taken to resolve it.
* Share any relevant logs, code snippets, or error messages.

> [!NOTE]  
> You don’t need to spend a long time troubleshooting, but you should demonstrate that you have made some effort on your own. This helps maintainers and community members understand the problem more quickly and provide better assistance.

### Reach Out to the Community

* If you have followed the steps above and are still stuck, [join the community](https://opentransitsoftwarefoundation.org/join-our-slack/) and post your question.
